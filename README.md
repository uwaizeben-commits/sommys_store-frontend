# Sommy's Store — Frontend

Quick Vite + React starter for the storefront.

Install and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend expects the backend API to be served under `/api/...` (proxy or same domain). When developing locally you can run the backend on port 5000 and use a local proxy in `vite.config.js` if desired.
